      <h3>Faculty of Education's Request</h3>
        <p class="foe-body">
          The Faculty of Education has requested the help of QED Technologies to assist in better optimizing their academic advising system. 
          The current system implimented by the Faculty of Education relies on complete physical printed records and handwritten notes containing 
          important information for each student. For academic advisors to access specific information on a student they must physically retieve the 
          students respective folder from a filing cabinet. This may require the advisor to sift through the folders which may contain large amounts 
          of information not relevant to what the advisor is currently trying to access. Additonally, the current system does not allow for student documents 
          to be easily edited, meetings or correspondence between advisors and students to be logged as well as access to student and course performance 
          data. Therefore, the Faculty of Education requests a proposed solution in better optimizing their academic advising system that will provide a more 
          efficient, reliable, and effective service for academic advisors and students.
